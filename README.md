# Recipe hub

I have a Github project which manages my recipes but would like better functionality. The goal here is to build a system which can interact with a Github repo to provide the benefits of git with additional functionality.

# Tools to play with

* Devise and Omniauth for account creation / management
* Github API w/ Oauth for repo management
* https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown -- used to display markdown
* https://github.com/ruby-git/ruby-git -- interact with a Git repo
